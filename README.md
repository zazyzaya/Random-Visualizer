# Random-Visualizer
Visualize a random number generator (With some math so it's not just static)

Some have said that you can use random number generators to communicate with "the great beyond". I don't know about that, but I did make something that generates random numbers, does a bit of math on them, then outputs some nice shapes that are fun to look at.     


Ghost-in-the-machine-hunters, you've been warned.
